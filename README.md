## My Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:
### [RFM Analysis](https://github.com/IcodeG00D/RFM-Analysis-Consumer-Behavior)
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. It's a smart way to identify high-value customers, inactive ones, and plan targeted marketing strategies.

### [Image-Captioning-Using-CNN-and-LSTM](https://github.com/IcodeG00D/Image-Captioning-Using-CNN-and-LSTM.git)

This project demonstrates how to build an image captioning model using TensorFlow. The model combines a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for generating captions.

### [Chrome-Extension](https://github.com/IcodeG00D/Chrome-Extension.git)

Voice Tab Switcher is a Chrome extension that allows seamless tab navigation using voice commands. With this extension, you can switch to the next or previous tab by simply speaking commands like "Change next" and "Change back". This enhances productivity by minimizing the need for manual tab management.
